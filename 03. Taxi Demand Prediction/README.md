<p>The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)¹ created in 1971, is the agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City’s medallion (yellow) taxis, and various other taxis. The yellow taxis are the most iconic taxis of NYC, which are widely recognized outside the USA too.</p>
<p>Yellow medallion taxis are traditionally hailed by signaling to a driver who is on duty and seeking a passenger (street hail), but now they may also be hailed using e-hail apps.</p>
<p>NYC has five boroughs Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. The yellow taxis are the only vehicles permitted to respond to a street hail from a passenger in all five boroughs of NYC.</p>
<p>Here, I will try out few models to predict the demand for only yellow taxis and only in Manhattan. Manhattan is the busiest borough of NYC by a huge margin. I started out whole NYC yellow taxi data, but later I decided to create a model for only Manhattan. I will explain why in later part of this blog.</p>
<p>
I have used following models for this problem<br>
1. Linear Regression<br>
2. XGBoost Regressor<br>
3. LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)
