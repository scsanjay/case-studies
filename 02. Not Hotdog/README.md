# Hot dog or Not HotÂ dog
Have you watched the "Silicon Valley" comedy series of HBO? If so, I bet you remember the Not Hotdog app that Jian Yang developed.
Here is a clip to refresh your memory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqTntG1RXSY

So basically this app identifies whether something is Hot dog or not. Well, we can train with other types of objects to identify them as well.

When I learned about CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), I was eager to try out some popular CNN models on this problem, just for fun. So I choose some of the best CNN models to try.

I have used the following models for this problem,
1. Variation of AlexNet
2. Transfer learning with VGG19
3. Transfer learning with ResNet50
4. Transfer learning with Inception V3
5. Transfer learning with Inception ResNet V2
