# Hot dog or Not Hot dog
Have you watched the "Silicon Valley" comedy series of HBO? If so, I bet you remember the Not Hotdog app that Jian Yang developed.
Here is a clip to refresh your memory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqTntG1RXSY

So basically this app identifies whether something is Hot dog or not. Well, we can train with other types of objects to identify them as well. 
When I learned about CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), I was eager to try out some popular CNN models on this problem, just for fun.
Specifically some of the best performers of ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition). 

I have used the following models for this problem,
1. Variation of AlexNet
2. Transfer learning with VGG19
3. Transfer learning with ResNet50
4. Transfer learning with Inception V3
